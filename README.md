## Overview 
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

### Objectives 
- Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions, especially about their visiting patterns.
- He believes that having deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
- He wants to know how much money they've spent and which menu food item is their favorite.
- He plans on using these insights to help him decide if he should continue the existing loyalty program.
- Also he needs help in generating a new dataset so his team can investigate the data without using sql.
